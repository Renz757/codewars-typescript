# codewars-typescript
This repository is dedicated to solving problems with typescript using codewars.
The problems are ranked 1 kyu being the hardest and 8 kyu being the “easiest”. 
I have completed many problems in the past but most of them are with javascript not typescript. 
I will complete new problems while also converting old solutions over to typescript and refactor as much as I can along the way, all while increasing the difficulty of these problems 

How to Run: 
OPTION 1:
I am using an HTML file with the live server extension in vscode 
please use "<script>var exports = {};</script>" above the script tag that links compiled javascript file 

OPTION 2: 
write, test, and run code directly from codewars website
